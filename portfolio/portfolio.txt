1-Machine Learning Development 
In my ML development, I've harnessed a spectrum of sophisticated methods to advance science and technology. Key techniques include LDA and Pearson correlation for feature selection, enhancing brain-machine interfaces. I've deployed a wide array of classifiers: MLP, kNN, RBF SVM, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Gaussian Process, emphasizing their application in projects like seizure detection and reinforcement learning for brain-machine interfaces, achieving up to 97% accuracy. Neural network models, particularly MLPs with ReLU activation and SGD optimization, played a pivotal role. My work, validated through methods like ten-fold cross-validation, showcases a deep application of ML concepts. Python libraries such as Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and Keras underpin these efforts, facilitating complex model development and evaluation.


2-API Utilization
In my work, I excel in integrating diverse APIs across various projects, demonstrating seamless data integration:

Indicator-Based Trading Bot: Analyzes market trends via financial APIs, executing trades based on indicators.
News-Based Trading Bot: Uses NLP to analyze market sentiment from news with OpenAI's API for trading insights.
Automated Data Collection Tools: Scripts for data aggregation, like NASA's APOD API, showcase web scraping skills.
Custom Application Development: Crafts applications with real-time data feeds, integrating dynamic APIs for content updates.
These endeavors, though not public, underscore my ability to harness API technology for innovative solutions in trading, data automation, and application development.

3-Web Scraping and Data Automation 
With the finesse of a digital archaeologist, my web scraping powers, ignited by multi-threading's fuel, create a potent blast of efficiency and speed. My mastery extends over Python's BeautifulSoup and Scrapy for data extraction, harnessing the concurrency of threading and asyncio to navigate and mine the web's vast expanses swiftly. Bash scripts, enriched with curl commands, complement my toolbox, enabling direct and powerful HTTP interactions. These techniques allow me to automate the capture of celestial wonders from NASA's APOD site and craft trading bots that navigate the financial cosmos with precision. My journey through data's labyrinth is a testament to the power of combining web scraping prowess with multi-threading's might, showcasing a capability to streamline data's journey from source to insight. While these adventures remain largely veiled, I am open to sharing the secrets of my methodologies with fellow explorers upon request.


4-Graphic Design Services 
Where code meets canvas, my graphic design services bring visions to vivid life. From the sleek simplicity of logos to the detailed depths of illustrations, my creative quest is fueled by a passion for aesthetic excellence. Though my portfolio remains a curated collection of confidential creations, I'm open to sharing whispers of my work with those who seek beauty beyond the binary.


5-Software Optimization and Performance Tuning 
In the domain of software optimization and performance tuning, I've honed my skills to achieve peak efficiency and speed across a variety of programming languages, including Bash, C, and Python. My expertise encompasses:

Maximizing CPU utilization through advanced multithreading techniques, significantly reducing runtime for computationally intensive tasks.
Employing optimization strategies in Bash and C for high-performance computing processes, crucial for projects requiring rapid data processing and analysis.
Utilizing Python's multithreading and multiprocessing capabilities to enhance the functionality and responsiveness of applications, showcasing my ability to leverage concurrency for cutting-edge software solutions.
This multifaceted approach to software optimization not only demonstrates my technical versatility but also my commitment to pushing the limits of what's possible in software development, ensuring that my projects are not only functional but also efficient and robust.

6-Data Analysis
My research integrates diverse data analysis techniques across multiple studies, enhancing signal processing and diagnostic accuracy. Methods include high-pass and band-pass filtering for signal integrity, Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for artifact correction, and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for detailed signal decomposition. I've applied Pearson correlation for feature optimization, and min/max normalization to ensure real-time applicability. These approaches have been fundamental in advancing brain-machine interfaces, improving seizure detection, and developing high-precision diagnostic models for Alzheimer's disease. Each technique, carefully chosen for its specific application, showcases my adeptness in both individual and integrated signal processing contexts, underlining the depth of my analytical capabilities in biomedical engineering.

7-Data Visualization
My work leverages advanced visualization techniques to make complex data analyses accessible and engaging. I've utilized several key Python libraries extensively:

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
Plotly: Enables sophisticated interactive visualizations for deeper data engagement.
Pandas Visualization: Offers straightforward plotting capabilities, integrated seamlessly with DataFrames.
Bokeh & Dash by Plotly: For interactive plots and web applications, especially useful for real-time data feeds and dynamic displays, such as in my trading bot project.
D3.js & NetworkX: Although D3.js is a JavaScript library, I've integrated it within Python environments to leverage its web-based visualization capabilities. NetworkX has been instrumental in visualizing complex networks and graphs.


8-Database Management and Design 
Beneath the surface of every great application lies the bedrock of a solid database. My expertise in sculpting these digital foundations is unparalleled, with tools like SQLAlchemy serving as my chisel.  From the architecture of APIs to the nuances of data processing, my work is a testament to the power of efficient data stewardship. Though the blueprints of these endeavors are held close, I offer glimpses into the depths of my database designs to those who seek enlightenment.
